## What We Do

[Covid-Taichung.com](https://covid-taichung.com) is a volunteer, not-for-profit project with a mission to serve an English speaking public with the most up-to-date, reliable information on how Covid impacts our lives daily in this city.
The core offerings of our project revolve around maps, FAQs/guides, and statistics, all rigorously maintained with the most accurate and official information.

### Maps

A comprehensive set of maps cataloging:
- vaccination sites,
- footprints of confirmed Covid cases, and 
- disinfection sites, 
in Taichung.

### FAQs/guides


### Stats


## Volunteers

You too can contribute to the project.
As of early August, the team's comprised of just over a dozen people contributing in a variety of ways like:
- getting the latest information from official government publications,
- confirming and clarifying this information directly with officials,
- cleaning up messy geographic data,
- translating,
- organizing, writing up, and editing this information into shorter summaries, and longer step-by-step guides,
- researching the needs of our target audience and the behavior of the users on our site,
- designing and coding the most effective web experience we can to best inform the public on latest developments, and 
- spreading the word through social media and public relations.

If you think you can join our effort, please contact us to introduce yourself and tell us how you think you could assist the effort.
